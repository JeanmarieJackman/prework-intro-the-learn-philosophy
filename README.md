# Welcome to Flatiron School

Welcome to Flatiron School! We're thrilled that you've joined our community of
learners! In this lesson, we want to talk about the Learn platform and
philosophy.

The Learn platform is designed for people who are passionate, curious,
self-driven, and serious about learning.

We are comrades in a never-ending quest for knowledge. While there are no
shortcuts, we believe that by providing knowledge in an optimized order,
reinforcing knowledge with hands-on, feedback driven practice, and providing
space for discussion, you will learn quickly. Learn is Flatiron School's
framework for delivering that experience to you. Our goal is to provide the
right materials, support and structure _you_ need to discover your own love for
the code.

## Learning to Write Code

This is the beginning of the Software Engineering immersive, where you will go
through everything from the basics of coding to building full stack React
web applications.

So, where do we start? How do we know what is necessary to understand _first?_
In this course, we're going to start with a simple idea - programming is like
having a conversation, and just like learning to talk, we need to start by
learning a few words and practicing them.

Typically when learning to code, you have to first deal with configuring your
computer, getting it set up to work with the programming language you're writing
in. This is often referred to as _setting up your environment_. You _will_ have
to do this eventually, but for now, Learn will provide the environment you need
to get started. Learn will give you a place to code. You get to focus on coding,
not setup.

Many people on Learn have already spent some time dabbling with coding by using
the amazing and plentiful resources all around the internet. In developing the
content here on Learn, though, we make no assumptions. This prework content is
designed for absolute beginners. Lessons build off each other, providing the
tools and concepts necessary to complete future lessons.

What we don't do, however, is dumb anything down. We believe in your infinite
capacity to learn. We do our best to offer a curriculum that is clear,
digestible, engaging, challenging, and deep. The curriculum you'll encounter on
Learn is rigorous and will demand that you be patient, resourceful, and gritty.

From the beginning, we'll make sure you have the support and tools you need;
you just need to bring the grit.

## The Learn Community

We don't believe in learning alone. As you make progress, expect to bump into
other learners just like you, ready and willing to help each other succeed.
Together, we can go further than we could ever go alone. We expect everyone on
Learn to be friendly, respectful, helpful, and nice. Learn is something special.

If you get stuck following the instructions, ask! If you get stuck getting a
coding concept, ask! Instructors from the community will be glad to help. There
is an ['Ask a Question'][aaq] button in all lessons on [Learn.co][learn] for
this reason, and we'll talk a bit more about this soon. You can also see
questions from other students who may be working on similar problems.

## The Learn In-Browser IDE

As mentioned previously, one of the time-consuming parts of getting started
with programming is setting up your work environment. There's a lot room for
error. Also, many computers need extra programs or setup to be used for
coding. Many would-be developers have tossed their laptops out the window in
frustration when trying to get their environment set up. They wrongly assumed
that "If I can't _set up_ the language, there's no way I can _use_ the language."
Nothing could be further from the truth!

Learn provides a solution for this so you can get to writing code faster: the
Learn in-browser IDE. The in-browser IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is
a fully functional text editor and command line interface, connected with your
GitHub account through Learn. It automates some steps for us and also comes with
some built in command line tools such as `learn`, used for running tests in
later lessons. If "command line" and "editor" are still new concepts to you,
don't worry, you'll be getting to know them soon enough.

To take a look now at the in-browser IDE, look for the 'Sandbox' button on the
top right of this lesson on Learn.

The Sandbox acts as a scratch pad for practicing as you read lessons. The
Sandbox will be available on every lesson in the first few sections of this
course and on any lessons that do not specifically require a student to write
code.

Any changes you make in the Sandbox **will be saved from lesson to lesson**,
including any files and folders you create. Learn automatically saves this
content on your behalf to a repository in your GitHub account called
`learn-co-sandbox`. 

**A word of caution!** Please do not touch this repository in GitHub, as it will
affect your Sandbox experience, and potentially cause your work to be out of
sync.

In a few lessons, you will be introduced to concepts like navigating a command
line. Soon after, you'll be working with the Interactive Ruby Shell, otherwise
known as [IRB][], and read-evaluate-print loops, or [REPLs][]. You can use the
Sandbox throughout these lessons to follow along. For example, if you open the
Sandbox now, in the bottom right section (the in-browser IDE's command line
interface), you can type `whoami` and press `Enter` to see your Learn account
name:

## Conclusion

You're just getting started, and we're happy you're here. To proceed to the next
lesson, press the "I'm Done" button on the right side of this page, then click
"Next Lesson".

Happy Learning!
